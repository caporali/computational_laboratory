# Computational laboratory
<p> Computational laboratory exam project at University of Pisa. The project regards the well-known <em>simulated annealing</em> heuristic method first from a theoretical point of view, and then two real-world applications are explored. The work is written completely in Italian. <p>

Title of the project:
<ul>
  <li> <em>Simulated Annealing applicato al TSP ed al modello di
Edwards-Anderson</em> (original) </li>
  <li> <em>Simulated Annealing applied to the TSP and the Edwards-Anderson model</em> (english version) </li>
</ul>

# Description
The source code for the simulations can be found in the [code](https://github.com/caporali/computational_laboratory/tree/main/code) folder. it is completely written in Python (version 3.8.0). <br>
It consists of 2 main experiments found in the [code_tsp](https://github.com/caporali/compuational_laboratory/tree/main/code/code_tsp) and [code_sg](https://github.com/caporali/compuational_laboratory/tree/main/code/code_sg) folder. The main codes to be executed are as follows:
- travelling salesman problem (tsp) - [code_tsp/main/main.py](https://github.com/caporali/compuational_laboratory/blob/main/code/code_tsp/main/main.py); 
- spin glasses (sg) - [code_sg/main/main.py](https://github.com/caporali/compuational_laboratory/blob/main/code/code_sg/main/main.py).
